Simple Linear Regression

Defining independent and independent variable, y = b0 + b1x. The best fitting line looks for the least squared difference between the predicted and the actual value. 
Follow the general steps of importing the libraries, uploading the dataset, and split in train-test dataset. 

Now the next step is training a linear model. 
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
new = LinearRegression()
new.fit(x_train, y_train)
