### Data processing in Python

I will be carrying out this course in both python and R. And would be using Google Colab for doing it as it is an free and open source alternative of Jupyter notebook and has all the libraries already imported.

#### Step 1: Imorting libraries
Generally three libaries are always imported.
Numpy that help us deal with arrays and most of ML datasets uses arrays.
Pandas that help us with variety of works and even importing datasets and matrices and features.
Matplotlib which is used for drawing graphs and visualising datasets. 
Way to achieve this:
import pandas as pd # for importing pandas
import numpy as np # for importing numpy
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt # for importing matplotlib libraries(the . used helps us to import a particular module from the library)

#### Step 2: Importing dataset(Important)
First of all we need to craete a variable that will contain the dataset. 
We will simply call it dataframe and dataframe will contain data in a partcular format called dataframe which will have elements in the same rows and column format. 
dataset = pd.read_cvs('Name of csv file with .csv extension') # used for importing the dataset.
Features -- the data that is dependent and is used for making the predictions. 
Depended variable is as name suggests is the result we want to predict based on the features. 
Now we need to define our x and y datasets to start with the model. 
So, for defining x we need to include everything except .the last column as it contains dependent variable and rest of it contain  independent variables or features that are used for training the dataset. 
x = dataset.iloc[:,:-1].values # So iloc can be expanded to locate index now for the particular indeces we need everything except last column so use :,:-1 for acheiving it.
y = dataset.iloc[:, -1].values 

Now you also need to upload dataset to colab to read it. In order to do this you simply click to folder icon on the leftmost portion and then click on upload button and select the required datastet from your computer system. 

print(x)
print(y)
To display the dataframes. :)
