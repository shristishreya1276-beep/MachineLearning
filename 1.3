### Difference between ML/DL and AI.
####  AI is the superset(or like the big umbrella) and it is anything that establishes relationship between machine and human and how we can train machines to do work for us. ML and DP comes under this big umbrella and to be more precise DP comes under ML too. So, ML has three major subsets, Supervised learning(when we use labelled input/output data and the main steps followed in this are classification and clustering), Unsupervised learning(which doesn't contain labelled input/output data and are try to find collerelations between the input data and major steps involved includes clustering), and then there is Reinforcement Laerning(which focuses on maximising the clustering data). DL on other hand is a part of ML which invloves training dataset with help of ANNs(Artificial Nueral Networks) and is generally used for images and text classification. 

So, the main difference between ML and DL can be addressed as in ML we mainly follow two initial steps first is to select the model which we will use to train and the second is manually decide the features that will be used for training the model. However in DL the intial steps include first selecting the nueral network that we will use and second then the network itself extracts the features that will be used for training from the input dataset. So, DL is generally used for big/huge dataset.
